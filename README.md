See [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) for the
history and rules of this beautiful game.

Being the *glider* my current avatar I thought it was time to write my version
of *Conway's Game of Life* in ruby :)

This is the simplest implementation I could write of the game in ruby, it's not
the best OOP code example but I think that while being written just for fun and
quicky it's compact and clear.


### Usage

Run the basic game in terminal with

```shell
  ruby run.rb
```


### Specs

Run them with

```shell
  rake
```
